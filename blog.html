        <h1><a href="#">Apple iPad Pro (12.9-Inch, 2018)</a></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blox-text">
       <p>Apple's 2018 iPad Pro is stuck in the middle again, now more than ever. The tablet sports powerful hardware begging for software that hasn't been written for it yet. It's very pretty, and very fast, but starting at $999 for the 12.9-inch model we tested, it's too expensive for the operating system and applications it runs. iOS was designed for simple single-tasking, single-application workflows. Its multi-window solution and Files app are kludgy bolt-ons. There's no great video editing software. Photoshop is coming, but not until 2019. There's less peripheral support than there should be. Ultimately, it just doesn't add up to a pro experience.</p>

        <h1><a href="#">News & Analysis SoftBank President Leaks iPhone 11 Release Date</a></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blox-text">
       <p>If Apple is true to form, the iPhone 11 will be released in September. And if the president of SoftBank is to be believed, you'll be able to buy one on Sept. 20.

		As 9To5Mac reports, during an investor event this week in Japan, SoftBank president Ken Miyauchi was asked when he expected the iPhone 11 to launch. To everyone's surprise, he managed to give away the release date in a roundabout way.
		
		On Oct. 1, a new Telecommunications Business Law goes into effect in Japan. It sees the end of carrier bundling when selling smartphones to consumers and means data and device plans must be sold separately. The reason the new law is important is because Miyauchi was asked how SoftBank would handle an expected September release for the iPhone 11 considering the new law being active the following month.</p>
